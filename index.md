# Hobbies and Interests
<hr>
In my free time, I enjoy working on challenges from **root-me.org** (**[profile](https://www.root-me.org/lovetdlc?lang=fr#cc278f2e5def6c08abfb11b28739cc1d)**), **TryHackMe** (**[profile](https://tryhackme.com/r/p/lovetdlc)**) and **HackTheBox** (**[profile](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/1555292)**), which are platforms dedicated to cybersecurity and ethical hacking. It allows me to sharpen my skills in various areas such as web security, pentesting, reverse engineering, and app vulnerabilities.

I also maintain a homelab server where I host various services to manage and secure my personal data:
- **Nextcloud**: for file synchronization and sharing
- **Vaultwarden**: for managing passwords securely
- **Immich**: for backing up and organizing photos
- **Plex**: for streaming multimedia content
- And some more...  
  
This server has helped me learn some skills about system administration, network configuration, and data security, as well as bettering my understanding of tools such as **Docker** and **Nginx Proxy Manager**.
